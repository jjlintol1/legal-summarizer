Legal Summarizer is a full-stack MERN application that utilizes the power of the GPT-3 API to automatically generate summaries of legal documents and end user license agreements. The application aims to simplify the process of reading and understanding lengthy legal texts by providing concise and accurate summaries.

## Features

- Automatic summarization of legal documents using GPT-3.
- User-friendly web interface for easy interaction.
- Ability to ask questions about previously saved legal documents.
- Responsive design for seamless user experience on different devices.
- Just input the link to the legal document, the company and the type of document and GPT-3 will summarize it.

- I was pursuing this project as a potential startup idea, but I decided that at the time I was building it, AI was not reliable enough yet to accurately summarize high-stakes documents such as legal documents on a consistent basis.
